# About Learn Proxy

Learn Proxy is a comprehensive educational project designed to help developers understand proxy concepts, patterns, and implementations using modern Java and Spring Boot technologies.

## Project Goals

This project aims to provide:

- **Practical Examples** - Real-world proxy implementations using Spring WebFlux
- **Learning Resources** - Step-by-step guides and documentation
- **Best Practices** - Industry-standard approaches to proxy design
- **Performance Insights** - Understanding the impact of different proxy patterns

## What Makes This Project Special

### Modern Technology Stack
- **Java 21** - Latest LTS version with cutting-edge features
- **Spring Boot 3.5.3** - Modern application framework
- **Spring WebFlux** - Reactive programming for high-performance applications
- **Project Reactor** - Non-blocking I/O operations
